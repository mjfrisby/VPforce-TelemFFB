- Change pause behavior to allow aircraft change to update TelemFFB while in the hangar

#MSFS
- Patch for aoa effect playing while aircraft is on the ground with no airspeed resulting in bad behavior of spring offset for aircraft with "aircraft_is_spring_centered" enabled

#General
- Added menu option to force an effects reset.  This can be useful if an effect gets stuck for some reason (sim crash for example) as an alternative to starting TelemFFB with the -r (reset) flag.  Use with caution in DCS and IL-2 as it is destructuve to any effects generated by the sim itself.

#MSFS
- **Cyclic hat-trim following for generic helicopters**
 - Follows the same setup as the trim following for fixed wing aircraft
 - Read this section in the manual for a refresher: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.gebv2sue64zj

#DCS
As more people have started building DIY pedals, there are some enhancements to the handling of FFB pedals in DCS with this release of TelemFFB.
Please read this section of the manual the detailed documentation which also links to a separate section of the document for tips on setting
up DCS to avoid getting trim events meant for your joystick sent to your pedals:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.bamrt98l8wd5

New pedal features for DCS:
- **Rudder trim for fixed wing aircraft**
- **Auto spring mode switching for Heli/Jet/Prop aircraft types (or per aircraft)**

Default Behavior is as follows:
- 'JetAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Static
   - Static spring based on configurable spring and dampening gain

- 'PropellerAircraft'
 - Pedal trimming enabled
 - Spring mode = Dynamic
   - Dynamic force based on configurable spring and dampening gain.  Force will be applied linearly with 0 at rest, %25 at the published Vs speed and %100 at the published Vne speed.
   - In an effort to keep as much complexity out of the config as possible, these Vs and Vne values are currently hard coded for the DCS warbirds, but instructions exist in the manual for overriding or for setting up a different aircraft to use dynamic pedal forces.

- 'Helicopter'
 - Pedal trimming not supported (sorry,  I tried multiple ways but DCS is too broken in this regard for helicopters that even have pedal trimming)
 - Spring mode = Disabled
    - Configurable dampening gain is available

#MSFS
- Add setting `center_spring_on_pause` to center with springs during pause/slew conditions
 - If true the stick will center with spring force when the simulator enters pause or slew
- TelemFFB will now auto-detect the aircraft category and engine type for all aircraft and load the appropriate default settings if no aircraft specific entry is found
 - Still possible for data from simconnect to be inaccurate
- Added engine/prop and jet (turbine) rumble effects to 'TurbopropAircraft' type
- Fixed jet engine rumble not playing for JetAircraft type

#DCS
- Extended the damage effect to support all FC3 aircraft
- Add setting to enable disable basic AoA forces effect `aoa_effect_enabled` (default=yes)

#MSFS
- Added VRS effect to HPG Helicopter class
    - new setting `vrs_effect_intensity` (%0-100, default %20)
    - will lightly shudder when on verge of VRS conditions, medium shudder when slightly into VRS, maximum shudder when VRS fully developed
- Fixed config.ini so gear/flaps/spoiler(speedbrake) effects are in the default configuration for MSFS aircraft
- Toned down the dynamic force effect on rudder pedals in non-FBW fixed wing aircraft.

#MSFS
- Hot patch for HPG H145/H160 implementation which greatly improves the hands on detection
 - There is a new `hands_off_deadzone` setting that will dictate when TelemFFB will notify the helicopter that spring override is no longer active
 - previously the hands on/hands off point was a single deadzone around the center of the stick
 - now a smaller "hands off deadzone" will prevent flapping of hands on detection as the stick will need to be much closer to center to trigger "hands off" than it did to trigger "hands on"

#MSFS
- New special integration with the Hype Performance Group Airbus H145 and H160 Helicopters
 - Full FFB integration with the AFCS for both the Cyclic and Collective axes (Tail rotor axis is planned)
 - Tight integration with the AFCS data provides a true-to-life experience with the Rhino
 - This was a 2-sided project with support from HPG to add necessary capabilities for TelemFFB to communicate the state of the axes for proper implementation!
 - Requires a minimum of Build 43 Patch 2 for the H160 and Build420 Patch 3 for the H145.  These patches are available in the HPG Discord.
- For a full breakdown of the capabilities and tips on setup, check out the VPforce user guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.f30c77lc61iq
- NOTE:  If you are running from python source instead of the exe release file, we have switched to a forked version of pysimconenct to support reading/writing of L:VARS in MSFS.  As such, you will need to `pip uninstall pysimconnect` and then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#General
- Added release notes for tracking updates
- Added link in UI to release notes file

#DCS
- Added intensity and scaling variables for the 'wind' effect

    -wind_effect_max_intensity    - sets an upper threshold vor the wind effect

#MSFS
- Auto detect Helicopter and Jet aircraft based on simconnect variable 'CATEGORY' to avoid executing
    effects that are incompatible with certain aircraft types if the module does not have a definition
    in the config file
